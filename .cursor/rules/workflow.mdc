# Task Implementation Workflow

When asked to implement a task:

1. **Read the spec first**: Open @SPEC.md and find the specific task referenced
2. **Check existing patterns**: Before writing new code, look at existing files in the same directory for patterns to follow
3. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/task-description`
4. **Implement the task**: Follow the architecture and patterns from project rules
5. **Write tests**: Every new service/check gets Pest tests (see testing rules)
6. **Run tests**: `php artisan test` — make sure nothing is broken
7. **Commit**: Use conventional commit format

## When implementing a validation check specifically:
1. Read `app/Services/Checks/CheckInterface.php` for the contract
2. Look at existing checks in the same directory for the pattern
3. Create the check class following the same structure
4. The check MUST return a CheckResult value object
5. Include a clear, actionable suggestion string for failures
6. Write Pest tests with at least one pass and one fail case
7. Register the check in FeedValidator's check array

## Important
- Don't implement multiple tasks at once — one task per session
- Don't modify existing checks or tests unless the task specifically requires it
- Ask for clarification if the task description is ambiguous
