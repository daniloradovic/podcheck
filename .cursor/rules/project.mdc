# PodCheck — Podcast RSS Feed Health Checker

Web tool where podcasters paste an RSS feed URL and get an instant health report.
Full specification is in @SPEC.md — read it before implementing any task.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Laravel 12, PHP 8.3+
- Frontend: Blade + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS 4 (via Vite)
- Database: SQLite (dev), MySQL (prod)
- Cache: File cache for MVP
- Testing: Pest PHP

## Key Commands
- `php artisan serve` — dev server
- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server
- `php artisan test` — run all tests
- `php artisan test --filter=ChannelChecks` — run specific group
- `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` — reset database

## Architecture
- `app/Services/FeedFetcher.php` — fetches and parses RSS XML
- `app/Services/FeedValidator.php` — orchestrates all checks
- `app/Services/Checks/` — individual validation checks (one class per check)
- `app/Services/Checks/CheckInterface.php` — contract all checks implement
- `app/Services/Checks/CheckResult.php` — value object for results
- `app/Services/Scoring/` — health + SEO scoring logic
- `app/Models/FeedReport.php` — stored report with results JSON

## Code Style
- Follow Laravel conventions (PSR-12)
- `declare(strict_types=1);` in every PHP file
- Type hints on ALL method parameters and return types
- Use value objects for check results, not arrays
- Services use constructor injection — never use facades in service classes
- Controllers are thin — all logic lives in services

## Git Workflow
- Main branch: `main`
- In this phase since we don't have other collaborators, commit and push to `main` directly
- Commit messages: conventional commits (feat:, fix:, refactor:, test:, docs:)

## Constraints — Do NOT
- Add authentication or user accounts
- Add payment or subscriptions
- Over-engineer — MVP first, refine later
- Use facades in service classes
- Create API endpoints — web only for MVP
